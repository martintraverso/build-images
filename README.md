# Build Images

This is a repository of docker images built to be used for build processes. Our main use case today is for leveraging AWS Code Build.

## Supported Images

Each branch in this repo refers to a different build image that can be leveraged by your CI/CI Process. We are currently focusing on Drupal and NodeJS builds, but we will expand into other language stacks as need be.
